            <h2>Unique Airbnb Stays Are So Hot Right Now!</h2>
            <h5>And They’re Here To Stay</h5>
            <p>After a year of pent-up wanderlust in 2020, Americans finally hit the road and traveled again last
                summer. Many fled the cities, breaking free from lockdowns and Covid restrictions. And they didn’t just
                want a change of scenery. They also wanted a change of lodging structure! From tipis and wagons, to
                potato and shoe-shaped “dwellings” — unique Airbnbs are skyrocketing in popularity. And they’re here to
                stay.</p>

                <h4>What Are Airbnb Unique Stays?
                </h4>
                <p>Airbnb has always been about unique experiences. Part of the company’s marketing strategy is to allow
                    guests to live like locals, providing homes with warmth and character. Homes with PERSONALITY. Not
                    cold, cookie cutter-type rooms.

                </p>
                <p>
                    That “personality” is what’s drawing people by the droves. Guests are hurriedly booking these types
                    of lodging oddities:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Barns and farmhouses</li>
                    <li>Yurts, tipis and tents</li>
                    <li>Treehouses</li>
                    <li>Geodesic domes</li>
                    <li>Pods</li>
                    <li>Windmills</li>
                    <li>Carriages/Wagons</li>
                    <li>Earth or hobbit houses</li>

                <h4>Why Are Unique Airbnb Stays Popular?
                </h4>
                <p>We all know how the pandemic changed the way people travel. Fear of Covid-19 drove many to seek
                    remote, rural places where they could physically distance themselves. These types of areas don’t
                    offer much accommodation, let alone a hotel.

                </p>
                <p>But that’s not to say there aren’t unique Airbnbs in urban areas as well. Tiny homes, yurts,
                        and treehouses have also been turning up in big cities. <a
                        href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1415908/reviews?source_impression_id=p3_1639918318_9i3pULXYmEdKDBC6">This
                            treehouse</a> in Atlanta and <a

                        </a> in Los Angeles are always booked.</p>
                <p>And because of their rarity, unique Airbnbs have become the destination – in and of themselves.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of them are architectural gems you’d never find anywhere else. Others are wacky, whimsical, and
                    quirky. But as long as they’re Instagrammable, they’re bookable!

                </p>

                    <img src="/assets/images/unique2.webp" alt="Poster" />
                </div>
                <p>And here’s the deal. It’s not just the guests who are walking away smiling. Property owners are
                    making good money, too. Airbnb says hosts with unique home stays have collectively earned more than
                    $300 million since the start of the pandemic. Their spaces range anywhere from $93 to $600 per
                    night.</p>

                <h4>The Future Of Unique Airbnb Stays</h4>
                <p>Is there much future in unique Airbnbs? You bet!</p>
                <p><a href="https://news.airbnb.com/the-great-outdoors-surge-for-spring-and-summer/">84%</a> of American adults
                        that Airbnb surveyed in February 2021 said they were “open to exploring” unique and remote
                        lodgings for a future trip. Cabins, barns and tree houses were at the top of their wishlists.
                    </p>
                <p>Vrbo conducted their own <a

                        demand for cabin rentals was up 25% year-over-year, and searches for chalets was up 20%. It said
                        61% of families that responded to their survey were more likely to pick an outdoorsy destination
                        than a city for their next trip.</p>
                <p>Aside from unique shapes and designs, guests are also looking for
