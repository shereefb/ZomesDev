                <h2>Protection and Retention of Personal Information</h2>
                <p>Zomes Development maintains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security,
                    confidentiality, and integrity of Investor Information appropriate to the nature of the Investor
                    Information we collect. While the measures we implement are intended to reduce the likelihood of
                    security problems, we cannot guarantee that these measures will prevent unauthorized access to your
                    Investor Information. In particular, information transmitted over the Internet may be beyond the
                    control of Zomes Development, and you are advised that such transmission may not be secure.</p>

                    password or account, and, if any unauthorized use is suspected, you should immediately reset your
                    password.</p>
